An android application I made to view my McDonald's work schedule on my android
phone. It's pretty simple, it just parses the web page and shows you in a 
somewhat more comfortable setting than just going to the page via the browser.

Things I Want To Add
------
There is a page where you can see the days you wanted to get off work, and where
you can add days. This is one I want to parse and show to, as well as the "news"
page, which is a lot less useful. If I am feeling really bored I will implement
a widget which shows the next time + date you need to work.
